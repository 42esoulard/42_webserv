Here's a pot pourri of ideas for those days when we got no idea what to do:
- handle authentication encoding/hashing, dehashing and checking
- add fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK) here and there to our fds before we handle them.
    I also think we'll have to add select every fcking where before reads.
