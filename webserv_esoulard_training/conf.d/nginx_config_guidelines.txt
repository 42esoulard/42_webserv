Simple directive example:
    simple_directive       setting;

Container directive example (or "blocks"):
    block {
        simple_directive    setting;
        simple_directive    setting;
        simple_directive    setting;
    };

----------------------------------------

Divide the config files! :
split it into a set of feature‑specific files stored in the /etc/nginx/conf.d directory and use the include directive in the main nginx.conf file to reference the contents of the feature‑specific files.
ex:
    include conf.d/http;
    include conf.d/stream;
    include conf.d/exchange-enhanced;

-----------------------------------------
Contexts = types of traffic(ex events/http/mail/stream)
ex:
    user nobody; # a directive in the 'main' context

    events {
        # configuration of connection processing
    }
    http {
        # Configuration specific to HTTP and affecting all virtual servers  

        server {
            # configuration of HTTP virtual server 1       
            location /one {
                # configuration for processing URIs starting with '/one'
            }
            location /two {
                # configuration for processing URIs starting with '/two'
            }
        } 
        server {
            # configuration of HTTP virtual server 2
        }
    }
    stream {
        # Configuration specific to TCP/UDP and affecting all virtual servers
        server {
            # configuration of TCP virtual server 1 
        }
    }

>>> each child of a context inherits the parent's parameters, but they can be overridden within the child.
